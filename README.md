### MITRE ATT&CK
https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/windows/

MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive knowledgebase of adversary tactics, techniques and procedures ("TTPS") based on real-world observations of cyber security threats. The data is layed out in matrices that are arranged by attack stages, from initial system access to action on objectives and impact.  Tactics are displayed across the top header as attacker goals, Techniques are displayed in columns and detail how attackers achieve those goals and finally the Procedures are the technical, finger-on-keyboard commands for goal execution


### MITRE SHIELD (Active Defense)
https://shield.mitre.org/matrix/

MITRE SHIELD is aimed to help cyber incident responders and threat hunters proctively subvert attacker activities by intentionally introducing breadcrumbs, in such a way, that the decoy data becomes virtually indestiguishable from legitimate data.  This affords SOC analysts and threat hunters a high-fidelity detection opportunity which can trap attackers as they seek to accomplish post-exploitation objectives on a compromised host.
