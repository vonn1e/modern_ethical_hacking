## Foundational Material

### MITRE ATT&CK
https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/windows/

MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive knowledgebase of adversary tactics, techniques and procedures ("TTPS") based on real-world observations of cyber security threats. The data is layed out in matrices arranged by attack stages, from initial access to action on objectives and impact.  Tactics are displayed across the top header as attacker goals, Techniques are displayed in columns and detail how attackers achieve those goals and finally the Procedures are the technical, finger-on-keyboard commands for goal execution


### MITRE SHIELD (Active Defense)
https://shield.mitre.org/matrix/

MITRE SHIELD is aimed to help cyber incident responders and threat hunters proctively subvert attacker activities by intentionally introducing breadcrumbs, in such a way, that  decoy data becomes virtually indestiguishable from legitimate data.  This affords SOC analysts and threat hunters a high-fidelity detection opportunity which can trap attackers as they seek to accomplish post-exploitation objectives on a compromised host.

### OWASP Top 10 2017 (currently latest)
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/

The OWASP Top 10 represents the cyber community's consensus on the most critical web application security risks. Although OWASP is currently the gold standard, web application developers and software engineers should seek to test their software against, PortSwigger's annual "Top 10 Web Hacking Techiques" report is a veritable contender and should also be considered:

### Taking Notes and Staying Organized
https://tools.kali.org/reporting-tools/cherrytree

Most Penetration Testers and Red Teamers loathe the report writing phase; however, if detailed, lucid, notes are taken during the course of the Penetration Testing engagement or Red Team exercise, it can make the reporting phase not only easier, but I dare say, even pleasurable.  Good reports are well documented, educate your audience in a non-technical language they can understand, respects the scope in the rules of engagement and contains an executive summary followed by a detailed attack narrative.  A finding summary and recommendations section should follow so needed actions can take place.  CherryTree is a great tool I often use to assimilate my notes before formally composing them in a polished report.

https://obsidian.md/

Obsidian is the new kid on the block and is actually my preferred method of taking notes now.  It will most likely eclipse CherryTree because of it's ultra-modern approach to recording information.  With Obsidian, everything is injested in Markdown.  What is Markdown you say?  Markdown is an open-source mark up language that lets you quickly and intuitively format text.  Obsidian, takes the best of Markdown and supercharges it.  For example, you can quickly make connections with notes and then view your links in graph view to get more ideas.  All panes can be pinned and split and grouped and rearranged into almost any style you want.  Everything can be tagged and searched. You can even view backlinks to see what sections of your notes are linking to your current active note page.  I strongly suggest you check out Obsidian, it's free and awesome!ddd
